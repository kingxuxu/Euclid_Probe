#enable_force_move: False
#   Set to true to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION

[respond]
#default_type: echo
#   Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one

#default_prefix: echo:
#   Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will
#   override the "default_type".
